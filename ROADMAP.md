Infinity Depths — Development Roadmap

«Purpose: This document defines the controlled development sequence for Infinity Depths.

The roadmap is sequential. Completing a phase does not automatically authorize the next phase; each phase has a gate.»

Project: Infinity Depths
Roadmap Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-09-02

---

1. Development Philosophy

Infinity Depths is developed as a long-term production project rather than a collection of isolated features.

The development loop is:

READ
↓
INSPECT
↓
UNDERSTAND
↓
PLAN
↓
IMPLEMENT
↓
TEST
↓
REGRESSION
↓
DOCUMENT
↓
REPORT
↓
STOP

No phase may be skipped because it appears unnecessary.

No phase may be expanded simply because additional ideas are available.

---

2. Phase Status Legend

⚪ NOT STARTED
🟡 IN PROGRESS
🔵 WAITING FOR VERIFICATION
🟢 COMPLETE
🔴 BLOCKED

A phase marked complete must have passed its gate.

---

3. Phase 0 — Full Repository Audit

Status: 🟢 Complete

Objective

Understand the actual project before changing it.

Tasks

Inspect:

- Entire repository
- Directory structure
- Source files
- Scenes/resources
- Configuration
- Dependencies
- Input
- Camera
- World
- Enemies
- Waves
- Defenses
- Combat
- UI
- VFX
- Audio
- Save systems
- Tests
- Build process
- Mobile configuration
- Unused files
- Duplicate systems
- Dead code
- Errors
- Warnings

Output

A verified map of:

- What exists
- What works
- What is partial
- What is broken
- What is unused
- What is missing
- What is risky

Gate

PASSED

The repository is sufficiently understood to begin project-memory documentation.

---

4. Phase 1 — Project Memory

Status: 🟡 In Progress

Objective

Create a stable documentation memory for the project.

Files

PROJECT_STATE.md
GAME_SPEC.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
ROADMAP.md
TECHNICAL_RULES.md
DECISIONS.md
CHANGELOG.md
TESTING.md
SAVE_SCHEMA.md
CONTENT_PIPELINE.md
AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md
ARCHITECTURE_DEBT.md

Required Outcome

Every important project decision must have an appropriate place.

Documentation must distinguish:

- Design
- Current implementation
- Architecture
- Decisions
- Future plans
- Testing evidence
- Known debt

Gate

All Phase 1 documents exist, are internally consistent, and contain no intentional contradictions.

---

5. Phase 2 — Source of Truth

Status: ⚪ Not Started

Objective

Establish the hierarchy used to resolve contradictions.

Hierarchy

GAME_SPEC
    ↓
Design Truth

PROJECT_STATE
    ↓
Current Reality

ARCHITECTURE
    ↓
Technical Structure

DECISIONS
    ↓
Why Decisions Exist

ROADMAP
    ↓
Future Work

CODE
    ↓
Actual Implementation

TESTING
    ↓
Proof

Rules

When two sources disagree:

1. Inspect actual implementation.
2. Determine intended behavior.
3. Decide which source is authoritative.
4. Record the decision.
5. Update the affected documentation.
6. Continue only after the contradiction is understood.

Gate

No unresolved critical contradiction exists between design, architecture, project state, and implementation.

---

6. Phase 3 — System Ownership

Status: ⚪ Not Started

Objective

Define authoritative ownership for every major gameplay system.

Systems

At minimum:

Core
Camera
Input
World
Enemies
Waves
Defenses
Combat
Economy
Progression
Collection
Merge
Bosses
Quests
Save
UI
Audio
VFX

Each System Must Define

- Owner
- State owned
- Data read
- Data modified
- Commands accepted
- Events emitted
- Events consumed
- Forbidden dependencies

Gate

No critical gameplay state has ambiguous ownership.

---

7. Phase 4 — Architecture Foundation

Objective

Stabilize the technical foundation before large feature expansion.

4.1 State Boundaries

Determine the correct boundaries between:

- Session state
- Level state
- Player state
- Economy
- Progression
- Collection
- World
- Save state

Avoid a God Object.

---

4.2 Event Architecture

Introduce controlled gameplay events where direct coupling is unnecessary.

Examples:

EnemyDied
↓
Reward
Economy
Quest
Statistics
UI

Audio

Events must have explicit payloads and ownership.

---

4.3 Data Contracts

Define and validate:

EnemyDefinition
DefenseDefinition
BossDefinition
RewardDefinition
UpgradeDefinition
QuestDefinition
MapDefinition
MergeDefinition

---

4.4 Asset Contract

Establish:

↓
Visual ID
↓
Asset Registry
↓
Asset

---

4.5 Save Contract

Define:

- Frame time
- Memory
- CPU
- GPU
- Entity counts
- Draw calls
- Loading

---

4.9 Build / Dependency Assessment

Evaluate whether the current manually loaded script architecture is sufficient for the next development stage.

Do not migrate build tooling merely for appearance.

If migration is necessary, define it as a controlled task.

---

8. Architecture Gate

Mandatory Stop Point

Before proceeding:

- State ownership is clear.
- Events are defined where needed.
- Data contracts are stable.
- Save contract exists.
- Testing foundation exists.

---

35. No Automatic Advancement

Completion of one phase does not authorize the next phase automatically.

After every gate:

STOP
↓
REPORT
↓
WAIT FOR APPROVAL

The next phase begins only when explicitly authorized.

---

36. Emergency Rule

If a phase reveals a critical architectural problem:

STOP FEATURE WORK
↓
DOCUMENT PROBLEM
↓
ASSESS IMPACT
↓
PLAN FIX
↓
IMPLEMENT FIX
↓
TEST
↓
REGRESSION
↓
RE-EVALUATE GATE

Do not hide architectural problems under additional features.

---

37. Scope Control

Ideas discovered during development are categorized as:

Required

Must be implemented for the current phase.

Important Later

Added to the appropriate future phase.

Optional

Recorded but not allowed to interrupt current work.

Rejected

Documented when useful so the same idea is not repeatedly reconsidered.

---

38. Definition of Done

A feature is not "done" because:

- A file exists.
- Code compiles.
- It looks correct once.
- The developer assumes it works.

A feature is done only after:

- Acceptance criteria pass.
- Relevant tests pass.
- Regression passes.
- Performance is acceptable.
- Mobile verification is complete where applicable.
- Documentation is updated.
- No critical blocker remains.

---

39. Current Position

PHASE 0
████████████████████ 100%

PHASE 1
███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  In Progress

PHASE 2+
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  Not Started

Current immediate objective:

Finish Phase 1 documentation.

---

40. Immediate Execution Order

The current manual documentation sequence is:

1. PROJECT_STATE.md
2. GAME_SPEC.md
3. ARCHITECTURE.md
4. ROADMAP.md
5. TECHNICAL_RULES.md
6. DECISIONS.md
7. CHANGELOG.md
8. TESTING.md
9. SAVE_SCHEMA.md
10. CONTENT_PIPELINE.md
11. AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md
12. ARCHITECTURE_DEBT.md

No implementation expansion occurs merely because these documents are being created.

---

41. Final Roadmap Principle

«The roadmap is a control system, not a wish list.»

Every phase exists to remove a specific class of risk.

The project advances only when the current risk is sufficiently controlled and the corresponding gate has been passed.
